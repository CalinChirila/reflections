1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When initializing a repository, I create a hidden folder that will keep track of all the different
versions of the document, at different commits. Otherwise, the folder will only contain the
earliest version.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers? 
The staging area is like the middle ground between the working directory and the repository.
The staging area contains files from the working directory that are to be commited and added
to the repository. The staging area gives the users some flexibility with operating files.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By using it to compare the files in the staging area with those in the working directory and the most
recent commit in the repository.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
How would branches help?
Branches are life-savers when it comes to trying out some experimental code or wild ideas.
With branches, we can explore as much as we want without the fear of ruining the working base code.

5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Like a timeline.
