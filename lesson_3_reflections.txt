1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whenever I would work from a computer different than the one I usually work on.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When working on large projects, or with many people, there can be a lot of changes happening
while I'm away. Having Git automatically stay up-to-date means that changes will be made to my remote
repository without my knowledge.
